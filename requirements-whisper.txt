# ============================================================================
# Pogadane - OpenAI Whisper Dependencies (OPTIONAL ALTERNATIVE)
# ============================================================================
# Install with: pip install -r requirements-whisper.txt
# 
# ⚠️ OPTIONAL: This is an alternative to faster-whisper (NOT RECOMMENDED)
#
# This provides a pure Python transcription solution without needing
# the external faster-whisper library. However, it is 4x slower and
# does not support speaker diarization.
#
# ✅ RECOMMENDED: Use requirements-faster-whisper.txt instead
#
# When to use this:
# - You cannot install faster-whisper due to platform limitations
# - You need the original Whisper implementation for compatibility
#
# Configuration:
#   Set TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER="whisper" in .config/config.py
#
# Models available:
#   - tiny (~75MB) - Very fast, basic quality
#   - base (~150MB) - Fast, good for simple audio  
#   - small (~500MB) - Balanced speed/quality (recommended)
#   - medium (~1.5GB) - High quality, slower
#   - large (~3GB) - Best quality, slowest
#
# GPU Acceleration (optional):
#   For NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA support, install torch with CUDA:
#   pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

# torch is installed automatically with openai-whisper
# If you need CPU-only version or specific CUDA version, install torch separately first
